Mandatory part of the task:

Animal hierarchy (OOP)
Animal behavior
Multithreading
Statistics on the state of the island at each tick (in the console)
Optional part of the task:

Bring the parameters to one place so that it is convenient to manage the “simulation”
Graphics instead of console statistics. This can be either pseudo-graphics in the console, or JavaFX, Swing…
Add other factors that can affect the simulation:
more animal species
different plant species
custom behavior for a group of animals (for example, wolves hunt and move not alone, but in a pack)
terrain on the ground, including a river that prevents the movement of some animals
